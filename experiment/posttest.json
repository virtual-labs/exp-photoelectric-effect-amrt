        "c": "Wave theory",
        "d": "Corpuscular theory"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Classical theory failed to explain instantaneous emission and frequency dependence.",
        "b": "Correct. Quantum theory explains energy quantization and photon interaction.",
        "c": "Wave theory couldnâ€™t explain threshold frequency.",
        "d": "Corpuscular theory was outdated by the time photoelectric effect was discovered."

      "question": "Which among the following is true in the case of Photoelectric effect",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is not an instantaneous phenomenon",
        "b": "The photo current is independent of the intensity of incident light",
        "c": "The kinetic energy of photo electrons increases with the frequency of incident radiation",
        "d": "The photo current depends on frequency of incident radiation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The phenomenon is instantaneous.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Current increases with intensity.",
        "c": "Correct. Kinetic energy of photoelectrons is related to frequency.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Photo current depends on intensity, not frequency."

      "question": "In the experimental set up for Photoelectric effect, photo-current becomes zero when the applied voltage reaches",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Stopping potential",
        "b": "Saturation potential",
        "c": "Zero voltage",
        "d": "Infinitely high voltage"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Stopping potential prevents even the most energetic electrons from reaching the anode.",
        "b": "Saturation potential gives maximum current, not zero.",
        "c": "At zero voltage, some current may still flow.",
        "d": "This is not applicable to photoelectric experiments."
