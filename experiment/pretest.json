      "answers": {
        "a": "Thermal emission",
        "b": "Compton effect",
        "c": "Photovoltaic effect",
        "d": "Photoelectric effect"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Thermal emission involves emission due to heat, not light.",
        "b": "Compton effect involves scattering of X-rays or gamma rays, not emission of electrons.",
        "c": "Photovoltaic effect generates voltage, not electron emission directly.",
        "d": "Correct. The emission of electrons due to light is called the photoelectric effect."

      "question": "The phenomenon 'Photoelectric effect' was first observed by Heinrich Hertz. The man who gave the correct explanation for the same was",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Einstein explained the photoelectric effect using quantum theory.",
        "b": "Planck introduced quantum hypothesis but didn’t explain this effect.",
        "c": "Hertz observed it but didn’t explain it.",
        "d": "Newton’s theories predate the discovery of the photoelectric effect."
