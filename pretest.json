      "question": "When UV light incident on a Zinc metal surface, few electrons are emitted. The phenomenon is called",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Thermal emission",
        "b": "Compton effect",
        "c": "Photovoltaic effect",
        "d": "Photoelectric effect"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Thermal emission involves emission due to heat, not light.",
        "b": "Compton effect involves scattering of X-rays or gamma rays, not emission of electrons.",
        "c": "Photovoltaic effect generates voltage, not electron emission directly.",
        "d": "Correct. The emission of electrons due to light is called the photoelectric effect."

      "answers": {
        "a": "It is not an instantaneous phenomenon",
        "b": "The photo current is independent of the intensity of incident light",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The phenomenon is instantaneous.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Current increases with intensity.",
        "c": "Correct. Kinetic energy of photoelectrons is related to frequency.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Photo current depends on intensity, not frequency."
