### Aim of the experiment
1. To understand the phenomenon Photoelectric effect as a whole.
2. To draw kinetic energy of photoelectrons as a function of frequency of  incident radiation.
3. To determine the Planck's constant from kinetic energy versus frequency graph.
4. To plot a graph connecting photocurrent and applied potential.
5. To determine the stopping potential from the photocurrent versus applied potential graph.
